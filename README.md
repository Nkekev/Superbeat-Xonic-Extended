#### Superbeat XONiC Extended v0.7

You will need an hacked 3.60/3.65/3.68 Vita with (Enso) Henkaku and the rePatch plugin in order to use this mod (rePatch ISN'T compatible with 3.69/70/71/72/73 Trinity, please downgrade your Vita with Modoru).      
rePatch download and instructions installation can be found here: https://github.com/dots-tb/rePatch-reDux0/releases/tag/3.0  
Either Cart or digital game can be used. You will need to have the official patch of the game to make the DLC engine working.  
This mod can be installed alongside all the previous official DLCs. 
Like all the DLCs from this game, this won't have any effect on your online leaderboard score.  
If you have the plugin ioPlus installed, make it sure you have the 0.1 version installed, not the 0.2.  
This is the 4th version of the project, it features 10 new custom exclusive songs and all the 20 PS4 official DLC songs not released on PSVita.

 * The glitchy notes on the official versions of Afternoon of Summer 6Trax FX and Donut Island 6Trax FX have been fixed.  
 * Loading times have been improved since the version 0.7 so we recommend you to replace all the files when updating your version of the mod.

#### HOW TO USE:

##### [Download here Superbeat XONiC Extended]( https://github.com/Nkekev/Superbeat-Xonic-Extended/archive/v0.7.zip )

Place the folders `readdcont` and `repatch` on the root of your memory card.  
Into `readdcont` and `repatch` folders, RENAME the folder called `RENAME_WITH_YOUR_TITLEID` by the titleid of your game.  
The titleid vary depending which region of the game you have so check it and modify in consequence:
- EU: `PCSB00891`
- US: `PCSE00717`
- JP: `PCSG00645`
- KR: `PCSH00167`
- CH: `PCSH00264`

Rename the `pic0.png` into your `ur0:appmeta/<TITLEID>/pic0.png` (Beware it's ur0 not ux0) folder by `pic0.pngbackup` to do a backup incase.  
Put the `pic0.png` from XONiC Extended on `ur0:appmeta/<TITLEID>/` (Beware it's ur0 not ux0)  
IF YOU HAVE OFFICIAL DLC (if you have no official DLC, just skip this part):
* If you have original DLC from Playstation Store, repatchAIDS is no longer needed to make mixed DLC working. Make sure to use the new release of [repatch plugin (3.0)](https://github.com/dots-tb/rePatch-reDux0/releases/tag/3.0) 
* If you have original DLC extracted with Maidumptool, you can just copy the folders named `SUPERBEAT00DLCXX` (XX number from 01 to 06 depending what you have) on the `ux0:readdcont/<TITLEID>` folder  
* We recommend you to use an overclocking plugin (like [lolita500](https://github.com/teakhanirons/lolita500) on PSTV or [PSVShell](https://github.com/Electry/PSVshell) for Vita 1000 and 2000) if possible for optimal experience since we encountered minor desyncs between background video and the song on very few tracks. It's recommended but not necessary if it doesn't bother you.
