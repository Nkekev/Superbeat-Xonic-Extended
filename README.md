# Superbeat-Xonic-Extended
A DLC mod for the game Superbeat Xonic on the PlayStation Vita

### UPDATE : This is the early 1st repatch demo edition !! The project has moved here with the Mid Dev Demo available : https://gitlab.com/Nkekev/Superbeat-Xonic-Extended

The project is at its very beginning step, this is a PREVIEW DEMO made especially for the new rePatch release by @dots_tb

You will need an hacked 3.60/3.65 Vita with (Enso) Henkaku and the rePatch plugin in order to use this mod. rePatch download and instructions installation can be found here: https://github.com/dots-tb/rePatch-reDux0

This mod can be installed alongside all the previous official DLCs. 
Like all the DLCs from this game, this won't have any effect on your online leaderboard score.

This preview demo contain only one song which is Marigold in 6Trax mode. If you try to select the 4Trax or 6Trax FX version, the game WILL CRASH, btw without ANY risk for your console or your save.
The content here is subject to further modifications.

HOW TO USE:

		Place the folder SUPERBEAT00DLC07 into the ux0:readdcont/<TITLEID> folder
		with <TITLEID> the title id of your Superbeat Xonic version (works with all regions).
  
OPTIONNAL:

		You can replace the pic0.png file on ur0:appmeta/<TITLEID>/

Special thanks to @dots_tb I worked with for months to make decrypted DLC working, this project would have never been a thing without his vitadev skills.
Thanks to the Kancolle Kai discord server for psychological support.
